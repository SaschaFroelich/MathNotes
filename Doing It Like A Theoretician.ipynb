    "# Doing it Like a Theoretician: 12 marbles\n",
    "\n",
    "A coworker of mine recently gave me and my other coworkers a riddle to solve. It sounded rather simple first, but turned out to be pretty tricky. My coworker, who has a PhD in theoretical physics, said it took him about a week to solve it at the time. The riddle goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "__You have 12 different marbles, one of which you know to be of defective weight. Using only a normal scale, how can you find the defective marble within three measurements?__\n",
    "\n",
    "After some trial and error it became soon clear that we wouldn't be able to come up with the problem on the spot. So we started thinking about it in a more orderly fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is more or less how we want about the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step, the question is whether to start measuring 6v6 marbles, or 5v5, or perhaps 4v4? While you might have the intuition about what the best first move might be, how can we formalize this? Can we be sure that one measurement is clearly better than its alternatives? Our idea went as follows: One should start with a measurement such that the _least informative result_ of that measurement returns more information than the least informative result of any other possible first measurement. We want to maximize the _information gain_! How can we do it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the first measurement there are 24 different possibilities: <br>\n",
    "1: marble 1 is too heavy ($m_1^+$) <br>\n",
    "2: marble 1 is too light ($m_1^-$) <br>\n",
    "3: marble 2 is too heavy ($m_2^+$) <br>\n",
    "4: marble 2 is too light ($m_2^-$) <br>\n",
    "... <br>\n",
    "24: marble 12 is too light ($m_{24}^-$) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we have no further information, we have to assume that each of these possibilities has the same probability. Now let's consider some of the possible measurement outcomes:\n",

    "# 1st Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6v6\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we start off measuring 6 marbles against the other 6. Then, without loss of generality$^1$, we can say that the left arm of the scale goes up, and the other one down: Case ($\\uparrow$,$\\downarrow$):"

    "\n",
    "What about the other possibilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4v4\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case there are two possible outcomes: <br>\n",
    "1) The groups are of equal weight <br>\n",
    "2) The groups are of different weight <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case 1: equal weight ($\\cdot, \\cdot$)\n",
    "\n",
    "From now on I will use the notation ($\\cdot, \\cdot$) to express that the two arms of the scale remain on the same height, i.e. the measurement shows no weight difference between the groups. In this case we know that none of the weighed marbles is defective, while the last four could each be either too heavy or too light, which comes down to 8 remaining possibilities: <br>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Case 2: left arm goes up ($\\uparrow, \\downarrow$) w.l.o.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the left arm of the scale goes up, we know that the defective marble has to be one of the 8 measured marbles. Furthermore, we know that if the defective marble is in the left group, it must be lighter than the others, and if it is in the right group, it must be too heavy. This leaves us, again, with 8 possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$m_1^-$, $m_2^-$, ...,$m_{7}^+$, $m_{8}^+$ $\\rightarrow$ 8 possibilities <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Aha! So if we measure 4v4 marbles first, we end up with 8 remaining possibilities either way, while we're left with 12 possibilities if we start with 6v6. While this does not prove anything$^2$, it suggests __very__ strongly that 4v4 is a better start than 6v6.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about 5v5, or 3v3? I will just put down the results, as I think the idea is clear by now:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5vs5\n",
    "\n",
    "($\\uparrow, \\downarrow$): 10 possibilities <br>\n",
    "($\\cdot, \\cdot$): 4 possibilities \n",

    "\n",
    "($\\uparrow, \\downarrow$): 6 possibilities <br>\n",
    "($\\cdot, \\cdot$): 12 possibilities\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So the least informative outcome of all possible measurements is most informative when measuring 4v4... Let's go for it then!\n",

    "\n",
    "## Case 1: ($\\cdot, \\cdot$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The scale does not tip, so the defective marble has to be in the remaining group of four. But is it too heavy? Is it too light? We could weigh 2 marbles of the remaining group against the 2 to bring the remaining possibilities down from 8 to 4, but let's approach this problem like a Bayesian! And what do those funky Bayesians do? Exactly, they use the information they gained in the previous step! So let's go ahead and weigh 4 marbles of group one (which we know are all good) against the 4 marbles of the defective group. The arm with the defective group goes down, say, so now we know the defective marble is too heavy. What next? I'll spare you the trouble: It's not possible to solve the problem from here. We could try to see which kind of measurement reduces the number of possibilities the most (in the worst case, of course) just as we did before, or perhaps some also get to the answer by sheer intuition. I'll just give you the answer to make things quick (the most interesting part is yet to come anyways): <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Measure 3 marbles of the defective group against three good ones. <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "### Case ($\\cdot, \\cdot$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining marble is defective. Measure it against a good one to see if it's too heavy or too light. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case ($\\uparrow$ (good group), $\\downarrow$ (defective group)) \n",
    "\n",
    "This case is almost as obvious, but not quite: The defective marble must be too heavy. Measure two of the remaining marbles against one another. If one side goes down, that's the culprit. If the scale doesn't move, it's the remaining one, and it is too heavy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this is a pretty wacky result: __If we are left with three marbles, we can find the defective one in one measurement _if_ we know what kind of defect (too heavy/ too light) it has to be!__ \n",
    "\n",
    "We should keep that in mind because it might come in handy later. And you know what? Let's call make it a theorem and call it Theorem A$^3$.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Case 2: ($\\uparrow$, $\\downarrow$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Again w.l.o.g., yadda yadda yadda. Ok, so now what? We know the defective marble needs to be one of the 8 we weighed... We still don't know if it's too heavy or too light, but if it is in the left group, it is certainly too light, and vice versa! Seriously, I suggest you stop to think about it for a moment, because this is where we were stuck for the better part of a week. What made it worse is our coworker who gave us the riddle didn't remember the solution. So we started wondering if he gave us an impossible riddle by mistake. Perhaps the original one was a little different? Ok, perhaps 4v4 is not the best way to start, perhaps there's something we didn't see... But wait: We are down to 8 possibilities: $m_1^-$, $m_2^-$, $m_7^+$, $m_8^+$. 8 possibilities, just as many as in Case 1. So it should be possible, right?! And yes, we computed the entropies, and yes we realized that that was just equivalent to counting the number of remaining possibilities (so you can forget about that entropy thing if you don't know what I'm talking about). What's going on?\n",

    "$(+++:---)$ :  measurement of three $(+)$ marbles on one arm against three $(-)$ marbles on the other arm. <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "We had this one idea to mix the groups. Something like $(+--:-++)$. Try it, it's intriguing and definitely a good start. That doesn't solve the problem, though, because at the end any similar approach comes down to this: If, say, the left arm goes up, it's impossible to say if the defective marble is one of the $(-)$-marbles on the left, or one of the $(+)$-marbles on the right. Any way we approached this, it always came down to that! So we stopped to resume what we got so far: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Theorem A: Three marbles of a known defect solve the problem. <br>\n",
    "2) When mixing the groups, any mix of $(+)$ and $(-)$ can only be present on one side. <br> \n",
    "3) Use as much of the previously gained information as possible. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's when it struck me. You know that feeling when you know that you came upon the correct proof without having it rigorously written down yet? You just know it's right, because it _feels_ right! This is what I saw:\n",
